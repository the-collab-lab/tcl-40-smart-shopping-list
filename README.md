# Overview

## Summary

This app was developed by a group of four junior developers through [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/). It's a smart shopping app that learns a user's buying habits and helps them remember what they need to buy on their next trip to the store.

## How does it work?

As a user, you will enter items (e.g., “Greek yogurt” or “Paper towels”) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.
